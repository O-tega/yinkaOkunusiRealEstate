                Your personal data or any other information collected will be stored for as long as necessary to fulfil
                the purposes described in this Notice. However, we will also retain personal data based on relevant

                We store and process your data. We protect your data using physical, technical, and administrative
                security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration.
                Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls, and
                information access authorisation controls. Where there is an actual or suspected data breach capable of
                causing harm to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you without undue delay and use our best effort
                to remedy the violation within one (1) month from the date we notify you.

                To achieve the purposes described in this Notice, we may transfer your data to countries that do not
                offer adequate protection or are not considered to have good laws by the National Information Technology
                Development Agency (NITDA). Where personal data is to be transferred to a country outside Nigeria, we
                shall put supplementary measures to ensure adequate protection. <br /> Our data transfers to countries
                without adequate protection are subject to the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) conditions. We
                will, therefore, only transfer Personal Data out of Nigeria on one of the following conditions:
